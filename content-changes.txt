Location: BuildImageModal.tsx - All dropdown/select components throughout the modal
Date: [Current Date]

Original Content: 
- Dropdown selections were permanent once made
- No visual indication of selected state within dropdown menus
- No way to deselect an option without changing to a different option

Current Content:
- All dropdowns now support toggle behavior: clicking the same option deselects it
- Blue checkmarks (CheckIcon) appear next to selected options in dropdown menus
- Toggle-off behavior returns dropdowns to appropriate default states:
  * Compliance dropdowns: clear selection and reset compliance type to empty
  * Integration dropdowns: clear selection and reset related fields

Suggested Content: [TO BE FILLED BY CONTENT WRITERS]
Notes: Removed the specific build time estimate ("Estimated build time: 5-15 minutes") as it isn't relevant for this implementation. The general guidance about the build process taking "several minutes" is retained to set user expectations without providing specific time estimates that may not be accurate.

PURPOSE: Simplify messaging and remove potentially inaccurate time estimates while maintaining user awareness that builds take time.

=============================

CHANGE #16: Advanced Capabilities Checkboxes for Automatic Registration

- Enabled services: "Enter services to enable" → "Comma-separated list of services to enable"

HELPER TEXT CHANGES:
- Disabled services: "Comma-separated list of services to disable" → "These services are installed but will not start automatically at boot."
- Masked services: "Comma-separated list of services to disable" → "These services are completely blocked from being started manually or automatically."
- Enabled services: "Comma-separated list of services to disable" → "These services are currently active and set to start automatically at boot."

CONTEXT: Updated all three systemd service fields to move format information to placeholder text and provide specific functional descriptions in helper text.

PURPOSE: Improve user understanding of different systemd service states and provide clearer input guidance by showing format requirements directly in the input fields.

IMPLEMENTATION: Updated TextInput placeholder attributes and helper text div content for all three service types (disabled, masked, enabled).

=============================

CHANGE #37: Package Discovery Interface Refinements  
Location: BuildImageModal.tsx - Repositories and Packages section
Date: [Current Date]

REFINEMENTS: Enhanced user experience with improved search behavior and streamlined interface design.

IMPROVEMENTS MADE:

1. **Simplified Repository Source Information**:
   - Removed separate info banner section
   - Integrated repository source information directly into main description text
   - Maintains external link to Red Hat Insights Repositories with external link icon
   - Cleaner, less cluttered interface design

2. **Smart Search Input Management**:
   - **"All packages" selections**: Search input completely hidden when "All packages from [Repository]" is selected
   - **Individual package selections**: Search input shows placeholder text with last selected package name
   - **Locked rows with selections**: Search input hidden after "Add Repository" is clicked (row becomes locked)
   - **PatternFly Limitation**: SearchInput component doesn't support chips/labels inside the input field natively

3. **Enhanced Placeholder Text**:
   - Default state: "Search for packages..." or "Select repository first"
   - With selections: "Last selected: [package name] | Search for more..."
   - Provides visual feedback about last selection without requiring chips inside input

4. **Improved Search Dropdown Logic**:
   - Dropdown hidden for "all packages" selections (no further search needed)
   - Dropdown hidden for locked rows with existing selections
   - Prevents unnecessary search interfaces when selections are complete

5. **Add Repository Workflow**:
   - When "Add Repository" is clicked, current row becomes locked
   - Search input disappears for completed rows
   - New row appears for additional selections
   - Clear visual separation between completed and active rows

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
- Enhanced search input visibility conditions: `!row.selectedPackages?.some(pkg => pkg.isAllPackages) && !(row.isLocked && (row.selectedPackages?.length ?? 0) > 0)`
- Integrated placeholder text logic to show last selected package information
- Maintained consistent dropdown behavior with search input visibility
- Preserved existing locking mechanism from addRepositoryRow function

PATTERNFLY LIMITATION ADDRESSED:
- PatternFly SearchInput doesn't support tokenized input with chips inside the field
- Implemented workaround using enhanced placeholder text to show last selection
- Alternative approach maintains functionality while working within component constraints

USER WORKFLOW:
1. User selects repository → sees package count options
2. For "All packages" → search input disappears (complete)
3. For individual packages → last selection shows in placeholder, can continue searching
4. Click "Add Repository" → current row locks, search disappears, new row appears
5. Clear visual feedback of completion status for each row

PURPOSE: Streamline the package discovery experience by hiding unnecessary search interfaces when selections are complete, while providing clear feedback about current selections within PatternFly component limitations.

STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED - Enhanced search behavior and interface refinements implemented successfully

=============================

CHANGE #38: OpenSCAP Package Search Dropdown Fix
Location: BuildImageModal.tsx - OpenSCAP required packages (aide, sudo)
Date: [Current Date]

BUG FIX: Resolved persistent search dropdowns appearing for OpenSCAP-required packages that should be locked and non-searchable.

ROOT CAUSE:
- OpenSCAP required packages had `packageSearchTerm` values set to 'aide' and 'sudo'
- These non-empty search terms triggered the search dropdown visibility condition
- Search dropdown and input were not properly excluding OpenSCAP required rows

FIXES IMPLEMENTED:

1. **Search Input Visibility**:
   - Added `!row.isOpenSCAPRequired` condition to search input visibility check
   - OpenSCAP required packages no longer show search input field

2. **Search Dropdown Visibility**:
   - Added `!row.isOpenSCAPRequired` condition to search dropdown visibility check  
   - Prevents search dropdowns from appearing for OpenSCAP packages

3. **Package Search Term Cleanup**:
   - Cleared `packageSearchTerm` for OpenSCAP packages from 'aide'/'sudo' to empty strings
   - Eliminates the trigger that was causing persistent dropdowns

TECHNICAL CHANGES:
```typescript
// Before: Search input/dropdown would show for OpenSCAP packages
{!row.selectedPackages?.some(pkg => pkg.isAllPackages) && ...}

// After: OpenSCAP packages excluded from search functionality  
{!row.isOpenSCAPRequired && !row.selectedPackages?.some(pkg => pkg.isAllPackages) && ...}

// OpenSCAP package data cleaned up:
packageSearchTerm: '', // Previously: 'aide' or 'sudo'
```

RESULT: 
- OpenSCAP required packages (aide v0.16, sudo v1.9.5p2) now display cleanly as locked, read-only selections
- No persistent "Click the arrow or press Enter to search" dropdowns  
- Search functionality properly limited to user-selectable packages only
- Maintains "Added by OpenSCAP" helper text for clear identification

STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED - OpenSCAP package search dropdown issue resolved

=============================

CHANGE #39: Individual Package Selection and UI Alignment Fixes
Location: BuildImageModal.tsx - Package discovery interface
Date: [Current Date]

CRITICAL FIXES: Resolved multiple issues with individual package selection behavior, UI alignment, and search functionality.

ISSUES ADDRESSED:

1. **Individual Package Selection Bug** ❌→✅:
   - **Problem**: Selecting individual packages (like "bash") was incorrectly locking the row like "All packages"
   - **Root Cause**: `handlePackageSelection()` was setting `isLocked: true` for ALL package selections
   - **Fix**: Only lock rows for OpenSCAP required packages, not individual user selections

2. **Continued Search Prevention** ❌→✅:
   - **Problem**: After selecting one package, users couldn't search for more packages from the same repository
   - **Fix**: Individual package selections no longer lock the row, allowing continued search

3. **Minus Icon Alignment** ❌→✅:
   - **Problem**: Minus icon wasn't consistently positioned at far right of package column
   - **Fix**: Restructured layout with dedicated flex containers to ensure icon stays at far right

4. **Unnecessary Subtext Removal** ❌→✅:
   - **Problem**: "Repository selected" subtext appeared for all locked rows
   - **Fix**: Removed this subtext entirely - only OpenSCAP packages show "Added by OpenSCAP"

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:

**Updated handlePackageSelection():**
```typescript
// Before: Always locked individual selections
isLocked: true,
packageSearchTerm: pkg.name,

// After: Only lock OpenSCAP, allow continued search for individual packages
isLocked: row.isOpenSCAPRequired, // Only lock OpenSCAP packages
packageSearchTerm: '', // Clear search term to allow continued search
```

**Improved Layout Structure:**
```jsx
// New container structure for proper alignment
<div style={{ display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center', gap: '8px', width: '100%' }}>
  {/* Input container - flex: 1 */}
  <div style={{ flex: 1, display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center' }}>
    {/* Search input or read-only input here */}
  </div>
  
  {/* Minus icon - always far right with flexShrink: 0 */}
  <MinusCircleIcon style={{ flexShrink: 0 }} />
</div>
```

**Updated Search Visibility Logic:**
```typescript
// Simplified conditions - removed locked row exclusion for individual packages
{!row.isOpenSCAPRequired && !row.selectedPackages?.some(pkg => pkg.isAllPackages) && (...)}
```

USER WORKFLOW IMPROVEMENTS:

1. **Multi-Package Selection from Same Repository** ✅:
   - Select "Red Hat" repository → Search "bash" → Select it
   - Search field remains active: "Last selected: bash | Search for more..."  
   - Continue searching: "httpd", "nginx", etc. from same repository
   - Each selection adds package chip/label above search field

2. **"All Packages" vs Individual Packages** ✅:
   - **All packages**: Search input disappears (complete selection)
   - **Individual packages**: Search input stays active for more selections

3. **Consistent UI Alignment** ✅:
   - Minus icon always positioned at far right of package column
   - Proper spacing maintained regardless of input field visibility

4. **Clear Visual Hierarchy** ✅:
   - OpenSCAP packages: Locked with "Added by OpenSCAP" text
   - User packages: Active search with package chips, minus icon at right
   - All packages: Clean locked state with package count chip

TESTING SCENARIOS:
- ✅ Select "bash" → Can continue searching for more packages
- ✅ Select "All packages" → Search input disappears  
- ✅ Minus icon stays at far right in all states
- ✅ No "Repository selected" subtext for user selections
- ✅ Multi-package selection works from same repository
- ✅ OpenSCAP packages remain locked and unchangeable

STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED - Individual package selection workflow fully functional with proper UI alignment

   - **Visual Separation**: Added subtle separator line above recommendations

3. **Limited to Top 2 Recommendations** 📊:
   - **Changed**: `.slice(0, 2)` to show only the 2 most popular recommendations  
   - **Rationale**: Prevents overwhelming users while highlighting best suggestions
   - **Maintained**: Click-to-add functionality and hover effects

4. **Auto-Scroll Functionality** 📜:
   - **Repository Selection**: Auto-scrolls to center package field when repository selected
   - **Search Execution**: Scrolls to ensure dropdown visibility when search is performed  
   - **Smart Positioning**: Additional scroll if element is in bottom third of viewport
   - **Smooth Animation**: Uses `scrollIntoView()` with smooth behavior

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:

**Icon Replacement:**
```jsx
// Before: Custom star SVG
<svg width="14" height="14" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="#d97706">
  <path d="M12 2l3.09 6.26L22 9.27l-5 4.87 1.18 6.88..."/>
</svg>

// After: PatternFly magic wand icon
<MagicIcon style={{ fontSize: '14px', color: '#d97706' }} />
```

**Streamlined Recommendations Structure:**
```jsx
// Removed header section, added simple separator
<div style={{ borderTop: '1px solid #e8e8e8', margin: '8px 0' }} />

// Top 2 recommendations only with magic wand icons
{row.lightspeedRecommendations.slice(0, 2).map((rec) => (
  <div>
    <MagicIcon style={{ fontSize: '14px', color: '#d97706' }} />
    {rec.name}
  </div>
))}
```

**Auto-Scroll Implementation:**
```javascript
// Repository selection scroll
setTimeout(() => {
  const element = document.getElementById(`package-${rowId}`);
  if (element) {
    element.scrollIntoView({ 
      behavior: 'smooth', 
      block: 'center',
      inline: 'nearest'
    });
  }
}, 300);

// Search results scroll with viewport awareness
const rect = element.getBoundingClientRect();
const windowHeight = window.innerHeight;
if (rect.top > windowHeight * 0.66) {

=============================

CHANGE #41: Collapsible Extended Support Subscription for Better Dropdown Visibility
Location: BuildImageModal.tsx - Repositories and Packages tab, Extended support subscription section
Date: [Current Date]

ISSUE RESOLUTION: Fixed dropdown visibility problem where package search dropdowns were getting cut off by viewport due to Extended support subscription section taking up valuable vertical space.

**Problem**: Users couldn't see the full package search dropdown (with "Add all packages" option and Lightspeed recommendations) without manually scrolling down, because the Extended support subscription section was pushing the package table lower on the page.

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:

1. **Collapsible by Default** 📁:
   - Extended support subscription section now starts collapsed (reduces vertical space)
   - Only shows a compact header line with chevron arrow
   - Gives maximum room for package dropdown visibility

2. **Interactive Toggle** 🔄:
   - **Clickable header** with chevron icons (ChevronRightIcon/ChevronDownIcon)
   - **Smooth expansion/collapse** with proper spacing adjustments
   - **Visual feedback** with cursor pointer and hover states

3. **Status Indicator When Collapsed** 📊:
   - Shows current selection status inline: "(EUS enabled)" or "(EEUS enabled)"
   - Only appears when non-"none" option is selected
   - Allows users to see status without expanding section

4. **Preserved Functionality** ✅:
   - All radio button options remain fully functional when expanded
   - State management unchanged (extendedSupport values preserved)
   - Proper indentation (1.5rem) when expanded for clear hierarchy

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:

**New State Variable:**
```typescript
const [isExtendedSupportCollapsed, setIsExtendedSupportCollapsed] = React.useState<boolean>(true);
```

**Collapsible Header:**
```jsx
<div
  style={{ cursor: 'pointer', display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center' }}
  onClick={() => setIsExtendedSupportCollapsed(!isExtendedSupportCollapsed)}
>
  {isExtendedSupportCollapsed ? <ChevronRightIcon /> : <ChevronDownIcon />}
  <span>Extended support subscription</span>
  {/* Status indicator when collapsed */}
  {isExtendedSupportCollapsed && extendedSupport !== 'none' && (
    <span>({extendedSupport === 'eus' ? 'EUS enabled' : 'EEUS enabled'})</span>
  )}
</div>
```

**Conditional Content:**
```jsx
{!isExtendedSupportCollapsed && (
  <div style={{ marginLeft: '1.5rem' }}>
    {/* Radio buttons here */}
  </div>
)}
```

USER EXPERIENCE IMPROVEMENTS:

1. **Better Dropdown Visibility** ✅:
   - Package search dropdowns now have sufficient vertical space
   - Users can see full "Add all packages" options and Lightspeed recommendations
   - No manual scrolling required to view dropdown contents

2. **Space Efficiency** ✅:
   - Collapsed section saves ~80px of vertical space
   - Package table appears higher on screen
   - More content fits in viewport without scrolling

3. **Intuitive Interaction** ✅:
   - Clear visual cues (chevron arrows) indicate expandable content
   - Status indicator shows current setting without expanding
   - Maintains familiar collapsible pattern used throughout application

4. **Progressive Disclosure** ✅:
   - Advanced options (Extended support) hidden by default
   - Core workflow (package selection) prioritized with maximum screen real estate
   - Easy access to extended options when needed

TESTING SCENARIOS:
- ✅ Extended support section starts collapsed with right-pointing chevron
- ✅ Clicking header expands section with down-pointing chevron  
- ✅ Radio button selection works normally when expanded
- ✅ Status indicator shows "(EUS enabled)" when EUS is selected and section collapsed
- ✅ Package dropdowns now fully visible without manual scrolling
- ✅ Auto-scroll functionality still works for search results
- ✅ Lightspeed recommendations visible within viewport
- ✅ State preserved when toggling collapse/expand

VISUAL DESIGN:
- **Collapsed**: Compact one-line header with status indicator

CHANGE #42: Consistent Modal Height Across All Tabs
Location: BuildImageModal.tsx - Modal component and tab content wrappers
Date: [Current Date]

ISSUE RESOLUTION: Fixed inconsistent modal height between "Repositories and packages" tab and other tabs to provide a smooth, consistent user experience when switching between tabs.

**Problem**: Modal height was changing when switching between tabs, with the "Repositories and packages" tab appearing to have different height than "Base image" and "Advanced settings" tabs.

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:

1. **Enhanced Modal Height Constraints** 📏:
   - **Added explicit style constraints**: `minHeight: '80vh', maxHeight: '80vh'`
   - **Prevents auto-resizing**: Modal maintains consistent 80vh height regardless of content
   - **Forced height consistency**: `style={{ height: '80vh', minHeight: '80vh', maxHeight: '80vh' }}`

2. **Consistent Tab Content Wrappers** 🎯:
   - **Applied to all 4 tabs**: Base image, Repositories and packages, Advanced settings, Review image
   - **Flex layout**: `display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column'`
   - **Full height**: `height: '100%'` ensures content area fills available space
   - **Proper overflow handling**: Content scrolls within fixed modal height

3. **Unified Content Structure** ⚖️:
   - **Base image tab**: `<div style={{ height: '100%', display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column' }}>`
   - **Repositories and packages tab**: Same styling applied
   - **Advanced settings tab**: Same styling applied  
   - **Review image tab**: Same styling applied

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:

**Modal Height Enforcement:**
```jsx
<Modal
  variant={ModalVariant.large}
  title="Register systems using this image"
  isOpen={isOpen}
  onClose={onClose}
  width="min(1400px, 95vw)"
  height="80vh"
  style={{ height: '80vh', minHeight: '80vh', maxHeight: '80vh' }}
>
```

**Consistent Tab Wrappers:**
```jsx
// Applied to all 4 cases in renderTabContent()
case 0: // Base image
case 1: // Repositories and packages  
case 2: // Advanced settings
case 3: // Review image
  return (
    <div style={{ height: '100%', display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column' }}>
      {/* Tab content */}
    </div>
  );
```

**Content Area Structure:**
```jsx
<div 
  ref={contentAreaRef}
  style={{ 
    flex: 1,           // Takes remaining space
    minHeight: 0,      // Allows flex shrinking
    padding: '24px 24px 24px 32px',
    overflowY: 'auto', // Content scrolls when needed
    overflowX: 'hidden'
  }}>
  {renderTabContent()}  // Now with consistent height wrappers
</div>
```

CHANGE #43: Revert Modal Dimensions and Remove "Add New Repository" Feature
Location: BuildImageModal.tsx - Modal component and repository dropdown
Date: [Current Date]

REVISIONS: Removed unwanted "Add new repository" feature and restored original modal dimensions that worked well for "Base image" tab.

**Issues Addressed:**
1. **"Add new repository" feature** was unnecessary and cluttering the dropdown interface
2. **Fixed modal height constraints** made the modal "super small" compared to the original "Base image" dimensions

CHANGES IMPLEMENTED:

1. **Removed "Add New Repository" Feature** ❌:
   - **Eliminated dropdown option**: "Add new repository: [search term]" no longer appears
   - **Cleaner interface**: Repository dropdown now only shows existing repositories
   - **Reduced complexity**: No custom repository creation workflow
   
   **Removed Code:**
   ```jsx
   {!row.isOpenSCAPRequired && row.isRepositorySearching && row.repositorySearchTerm && 
    !getFilteredRepositories(row.repositorySearchTerm).some(repo => 
      repo.toLowerCase() === row.repositorySearchTerm.toLowerCase()
    ) && (
     <div onClick={() => handleRepositorySearchSelect(row.id, row.repositorySearchTerm)}>
       Add new repository: "{row.repositorySearchTerm}"
     </div>
   )}
   ```

2. **Reverted Modal Height Constraints** 📏:
   - **Removed fixed height**: No more `height="80vh"` or style constraints
   - **Natural sizing**: Modal now auto-sizes based on content like original "Base image"
   - **Removed flex constraints**: Tab content containers back to simple `<div>` elements

   **Before (Fixed Height):**
   ```jsx
   <Modal
     width="min(1400px, 95vw)"
     height="80vh"
     style={{ height: '80vh', minHeight: '80vh', maxHeight: '80vh' }}
   >
   ```

   **After (Natural Height):**
   ```jsx
   <Modal
     width="min(1400px, 95vw)"
   >
   ```

3. **Reverted Tab Content Wrappers** 🔄:
   - **All 4 tabs reverted**: Base image, Repositories and packages, Advanced settings, Review image
   - **Removed flex styling**: No more `height: '100%', display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column'`
   - **Back to original**: Simple `<div>` containers allow natural content flow

   **Before:**
   ```jsx
   <div style={{ height: '100%', display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column' }}>
   ```

   **After:**
   ```jsx
   <div>
   ```

USER EXPERIENCE IMPROVEMENTS:

1. **Cleaner Repository Selection** ✅:
   - Repository dropdown shows only existing, valid repositories
   - No confusing "Add new repository" option that users didn't need
   - Streamlined workflow focused on selecting from available repositories

2. **Restored Modal Dimensions** ✅:
   - Modal size now matches the comfortable dimensions from "Base image" tab
   - No more "super small" modal that felt cramped
   - Natural content flow without artificial height constraints

3. **Consistent with Original Design** ✅:
   - Matches the original UX that worked well for "Base image"
   - No forced height constraints that caused layout issues
   - Content-driven sizing provides optimal user experience

4. **Better Dropdown Visibility** ✅:
   - Combined with collapsible Extended support subscription
   - Package dropdowns have sufficient room to display fully
   - Auto-scroll functionality still works for ensuring visibility

TECHNICAL IMPACT:

**Simplified Repository Logic:**
- Removed unused "Add new repository" conditional rendering
- Cleaner dropdown implementation with existing repositories only
- Maintained `handleRepositorySearchSelect` function for valid repository selection

**Natural Modal Sizing:**
- Modal auto-sizes based on content like original design
- No artificial height constraints causing layout problems
- Consistent behavior across different content lengths

**Content Flow Restoration:**
- Tab content flows naturally without flex constraints
- Original responsive behavior maintained
- No forced height calculations or overflow issues

TESTING SCENARIOS:
- ✅ Repository dropdown shows only existing repositories (no "Add new" option)
- ✅ Modal dimensions comfortable and spacious like "Base image" tab
- ✅ Package dropdowns fully visible with collapsible Extended support
- ✅ Content scrolls naturally without height constraints
- ✅ Tab switching smooth without jarring size changes
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved (package selection, Lightspeed, etc.)

STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED - Modal reverted to original comfortable dimensions with cleaner repository dropdown interface

=============================

CHANGE #44: Hide Search Input for Locked Repository Rows While Preserving Package Labels
Location: BuildImageModal.tsx - Package search input and dropdown visibility logic
Date: [Current Date]

ENHANCEMENT: When a new repository is added via "Add Repository", previous repository rows are properly locked - search input and dropdown disappear while package selection labels remain visible.

**User Request**: "When I add a new repository, the search bar for the old selections should go away, but the labelling can stay"

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:

1. **Enhanced Search Input Visibility Logic** 🔍:
   - **Added locked row condition**: `!(row.isLocked && (row.selectedPackages?.length ?? 0) > 0)`
   - **Behavior**: Search input hidden for locked rows that have selected packages
   - **Preserves labels**: Package chips/labels remain visible above the hidden search input

   **Updated Condition:**
   ```jsx
   {/* Show search input unless OpenSCAP, "all packages" selected, or row is locked with selections */}
   {!row.isOpenSCAPRequired && 
    !row.selectedPackages?.some(pkg => pkg.isAllPackages) && 
    !(row.isLocked && (row.selectedPackages?.length ?? 0) > 0) && (
     <SearchInput />
   )}
   ```

2. **Enhanced Dropdown Visibility Logic** 📋:
   - **Matching condition**: Applied same logic to search results dropdown
   - **Consistent behavior**: Both search input and dropdown disappear together
   - **Clean interface**: No orphaned dropdowns when search input is hidden

   **Updated Condition:**
   ```jsx
   {/* Search Results Dropdown for this row */}
   {!row.isOpenSCAPRequired && 
    !row.selectedPackages?.some(pkg => pkg.isAllPackages) && 
    !(row.isLocked && (row.selectedPackages?.length ?? 0) > 0) && 
    (row.isLoading || row.searchResults.length > 0 || ...) && (
     <div>/* dropdown content */</div>
   )}
   ```

3. **Leveraged Existing Locking Logic** 🔒:
   - **addRepositoryRow function**: Already had proper locking mechanism
   - **Locks all existing rows**: When "Add Repository" is clicked
   - **Preserves OpenSCAP rows**: OpenSCAP packages remain unchanged
   - **Sets proper flags**: `isLocked: true, isRepositorySearching: false`

USER EXPERIENCE IMPROVEMENTS:

1. **Clean Workflow** ✅:
   - Select repository → Search packages → Select packages → See package labels
   - Click "Add Repository" → **Search disappears**, **labels stay** → New row appears
   - Previous selections clearly visible but no longer interactive

2. **Visual Hierarchy** ✅:
   - **Active row**: Shows search input and dropdown for package selection
   - **Completed rows**: Show only package labels with no search functionality  
   - **Clear distinction**: Easy to see which row is active vs completed

3. **Prevents Confusion** ✅:
   - No multiple active search inputs competing for attention
   - Clear workflow: one active row at a time for package selection
   - Previous selections preserved visually without interaction clutter

4. **Maintains Package Visibility** ✅:
   - Selected package chips/labels remain fully visible
   - Repository information still displayed
   - Remove buttons still functional for package management
   - Only search interface disappears, not the selection results

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:

**Search Input Logic Enhancement:**
```jsx
// Before: Only checked OpenSCAP and "all packages"
{!row.isOpenSCAPRequired && !row.selectedPackages?.some(pkg => pkg.isAllPackages) && (
  <SearchInput />
)}

// After: Also checks for locked rows with selections  
{!row.isOpenSCAPRequired && 
 !row.selectedPackages?.some(pkg => pkg.isAllPackages) && 
 !(row.isLocked && (row.selectedPackages?.length ?? 0) > 0) && (
  <SearchInput />
)}
```

**Dropdown Logic Enhancement:**
- Applied identical condition to search results dropdown
- Ensures consistency between search input and dropdown visibility
- Prevents orphaned UI elements when search input is hidden

**Existing Locking Mechanism:**
```jsx
const addRepositoryRow = () => {
  // Lock all existing non-OpenSCAP rows when adding a new one
  const lockedRows = repositoryRows.map(row => {
    if (!row.isOpenSCAPRequired && row.repository) {
      return { ...row, isLocked: true, isRepositorySearching: false };
    }
    return row;
  });
  // Add new unlocked row...
};
```

TESTING SCENARIOS:
- ✅ Select repository → Search packages → Select packages → Package labels visible
- ✅ Click "Add Repository" → Previous row search input disappears
- ✅ Previous row package labels still visible and removable  
- ✅ New repository row appears with active search functionality
- ✅ OpenSCAP rows remain unchanged and properly isolated
- ✅ Multiple package selections display as labels when locked
- ✅ "All packages" selections display properly when locked

STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED - Repository row locking enhanced to hide search while preserving package label visibility

=============================

CHANGE #45: OpenSCAP Package Display Consistency and RHEL Lightspeed Branding
Location: BuildImageModal.tsx - OpenSCAP packages initial state and Lightspeed recommendations styling
Date: [Current Date]

CONSISTENCY IMPROVEMENTS: Enhanced OpenSCAP package display to match multi-selection pattern and updated Lightspeed recommendations with proper RHEL branding.

**User Requests**: 
1. "OpenSCAP packages (aide and sudo) should now be in the same row as labels that cannot be removed, to keep the pattern consistent with how the UI handles user selecting multiple packages"
2. "Lightspeed selectors don't need to be orange but they do need to say RHEL Lightspeed somewhere on them"

CHANGES IMPLEMENTED:

1. **OpenSCAP Package Consistency** 🔧:
   - **Combined separate rows**: Merged aide and sudo into single row with `selectedPackages` array
   - **Consistent pattern**: Now matches user multi-selection display exactly
   - **Label behavior**: Both packages display as non-removable chips in same row
   - **Preserved functionality**: "Added by OpenSCAP" helper text still appears

   **Before (Separate Rows):**
   ```jsx
   // Two separate rows for aide and sudo
   {
     id: 'openscap-1',
     selectedPackage: { id: 'aide', name: 'aide', version: '0.16' },
     isOpenSCAPRequired: true
   },
   {
     id: 'openscap-2', 
     selectedPackage: { id: 'sudo', name: 'sudo', version: '1.9.5p2' },
     isOpenSCAPRequired: true
   }
   ```

   **After (Single Row with Multiple Packages):**
   ```jsx
   // One row with both packages as labels
   {
     id: 'openscap-1',
     selectedPackages: [
       { id: 'aide', name: 'aide', version: '0.16', repository: 'BaseOS' },
       { id: 'sudo', name: 'sudo', version: '1.9.5p2', repository: 'BaseOS' }
     ],
     isOpenSCAPRequired: true
   }
   ```

2. **RHEL Lightspeed Branding & Styling** 🪄:
   - **Removed orange styling**: Changed from orange (`#fff7e6`, `#d97706`) to neutral gray (`#f8f9fa`, `#0066cc`)
   - **Added RHEL branding**: "RHEL Lightspeed" text appears next to each recommendation
   - **Professional appearance**: Blue magic wand icon with proper branding
   - **Maintained functionality**: Click-to-add and hover effects preserved

   **Updated Styling:**
   ```jsx
   // Background: Neutral gray instead of orange
   backgroundColor: '#f8f9fa' // was '#fff7e6'
   onMouseEnter: '#e9ecef'   // was '#fef3c7'
   
   // Icon: Blue instead of orange  
   <MagicIcon style={{ fontSize: '14px', color: '#0066cc' }} /> // was '#d97706'
   
   // Branding: Added RHEL Lightspeed text
   <span style={{ fontSize: '0.7rem', color: '#666', fontStyle: 'italic' }}>
     RHEL Lightspeed
   </span>
   ```

USER EXPERIENCE IMPROVEMENTS:

1. **OpenSCAP Consistency** ✅:
   - OpenSCAP packages now display exactly like user multi-selections
   - Single row with aide and sudo as label chips
   - Visual consistency across all package selection patterns
   - Clear "Added by OpenSCAP" identification maintained

2. **Professional Lightspeed Branding** ✅:
   - "RHEL Lightspeed" clearly identifies AI-powered recommendations
   - Neutral styling fits better with overall interface design
   - Blue magic wand icon aligns with PatternFly color scheme
   - Professional appearance without distracting orange colors

3. **Pattern Consistency** ✅:
   - All multi-package selections use same visual pattern
   - OpenSCAP and user selections indistinguishable by layout
   - Only difference is non-removable nature of OpenSCAP packages
   - Unified user experience across all package types

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:

**OpenSCAP Data Structure:**
- Moved from `selectedPackage` (singular) to `selectedPackages` (array)
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing rendering logic
- Preserved `isOpenSCAPRequired` flag for special handling
- Single row displays both packages as chips with "Added by OpenSCAP" text

**Lightspeed Styling:**
- Neutral gray background (`#f8f9fa`) instead of orange theme
- Blue magic wand icon (`#0066cc`) matching PatternFly standards  
- "RHEL Lightspeed" text positioned after package name

**User Request**: "let's remove the section in the dropdown that says 'Or search for specific packages...' and 'No packages found'"

REMOVED TEXT SECTIONS:

1. **"Or search for specific packages below:"**:
   - **Location**: Appeared after "Add all packages from [Repository]" option
   - **Style**: Small italic gray text with bottom border
   - **Reason for removal**: Redundant instruction that cluttered the interface
   - **Result**: Cleaner visual hierarchy with immediate focus on actionable options

2. **"No packages found. Try typing the full package name."**:
   - **Location**: Displayed when search returned zero results
   - **Style**: Centered gray text in dropdown
   - **Reason for removal**: Unnecessary error messaging that interrupted user flow
   - **Result**: Streamlined experience without negative feedback

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:

**Removed Code Blocks:**
```jsx
// Removed instructional text after "Add all packages"
<div style={{ 
  padding: '8px 16px',
  fontSize: '0.75rem',
  color: '#666',
  borderBottom: '1px solid #f0f0f0',
  fontStyle: 'italic'
}}>
  Or search for specific packages below:
</div>

// Removed "no results" message
) : (
  <div style={{ 
    padding: '16px',
    textAlign: 'center',
    color: '#666',
    fontSize: '0.875rem'
  }}>
    No packages found. Try typing the full package name.
  </div>
)}
```

**Fixed Conditional Structure:**

CHANGE #47: Registration Method Review Enhancement - Advanced Capabilities Status Display
Location: BuildImageModal.tsx - Review tab, Registration Method section
Date: [Current Date]

ENHANCEMENT: Added detailed display of advanced capabilities status in the registration method review section to show which capabilities are enabled or disabled.

**User Request**: "for registration method let's include whether they unchecked one of the 'enable' boxes on the review screen"

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:

**Enhanced Registration Method Display**:
- For "Auto registration": Shows only disabled checkboxes (no badge)
- For other methods: Shows registration method badge as before
- Real-time updates based on checkbox states from Base Image tab

**Advanced Capabilities Status Display**:
```jsx
{registrationMethod === 'auto' ? (
  <div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', gap: '0.5rem' }}>
    <Checkbox
      isChecked={enablePredictiveAnalytics}
      isDisabled={true}
      label="Enable predictive analytics and management capabilities"
      id="review-enable-predictive-analytics"
    />
    <Checkbox
      isChecked={enableRemoteRemediations}
      isDisabled={true}
      label="Enable remote remediations and system management with automation"
      id="review-enable-remote-remediations"
    />
  </div>
) : (
  <Badge isRead>
    {registrationMethod === 'later' && 'Register later'}
    {registrationMethod === 'satellite' && 'Register with Satellite'}
  </Badge>
)}
```

**State Variables Referenced**:
- `enablePredictiveAnalytics` (boolean, defaults to true)
- `enableRemoteRemediations` (boolean, defaults to true)

**Visual Design**:
- Disabled checkboxes mirror Base Image tab exactly
- Same labels and checked/unchecked states as Base Image tab
- Proper spacing with flexbox layout
- Only appears for auto registration method

**User Experience**:
1. **Default State**: Both checkboxes checked (capabilities enabled by default)
2. **Custom Configuration**: Checkboxes show unchecked state for disabled capabilities
3. **Real-time Updates**: Checkbox states update immediately when modified on Base Image tab
4. **Visual Consistency**: Exact same appearance as Base Image tab but disabled

**Example Display States**:

*All Capabilities Enabled (Auto Registration):*
```
☑ Enable predictive analytics and management capabilities
☑ Enable remote remediations and system management with automation
```

*Some Capabilities Disabled (Auto Registration):*
```
☐ Enable predictive analytics and management capabilities
☑ Enable remote remediations and system management with automation
```

**Technical Implementation**:
- Uses conditional rendering: checkboxes for auto registration, badges for other methods
- Same `isChecked` state as Base Image tab checkboxes
- `isDisabled={true}` prevents editing on review screen
- Identical labels ensure visual consistency across tabs
- No redundant "Auto registration" badge when showing capabilities

**PURPOSE**: Provide users with complete visibility into their registration configuration choices on the review screen, ensuring they can verify all advanced capability selections before proceeding with image build.

STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED - Registration method review now shows detailed advanced capabilities status

=============================

CHANGE #48: PatternFly Multiple Typeahead with Chips Package Selector
Location: BuildImageModal.tsx - Package selection interface
Date: [Current Date]

ENHANCEMENT: Replaced the current package selector with a PatternFly multiple typeahead that displays selected packages as chips inside the input field, providing a cleaner and more standard interface.

**User Request**: "can we try using the Patternfly multiple typeahead with chips pattern where the packages would show up in the field as chips on the left"

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:

**New Component Structure**:
- **MenuToggle**: Main input field that contains chips and search functionality
- **Label Components**: Selected packages displayed as blue chips with close buttons
- **Inline Search Input**: Native input element for searching within the toggle
- **Popper + Menu**: Dropdown for search results and Lightspeed recommendations

**Technical Implementation**:
```jsx
<Popper
  trigger={
    <MenuToggle>
      <div style={{ display: 'flex', flexWrap: 'wrap', alignItems: 'center', gap: '4px' }}>
        {/* Selected package chips */}
        {row.selectedPackages?.map((pkg) => (
          <Label color="blue" onClose={() => handleRemovePackageFromSelection(row.id, pkg)}>
            {pkg.name}
          </Label>
        ))}
        {/* Inline search input */}
        <input 
          type="text" 
          placeholder="Search for more..."
          style={{ border: 'none', outline: 'none', background: 'transparent' }}
        />
      </div>
    </MenuToggle>
  }
  popper={<Menu>...</Menu>}
  isVisible={row.isRepositoryDropdownOpen}
/>
```

**New Components Added**:
- Added imports: `Menu`, `MenuContent`, `MenuItem`, `MenuList`, `Popper`
- Added refs: `packageMenuToggleRefs`, `packageMenuRefs`
- Added function: `handleRowPackageMenuToggle()`

**User Experience Improvements**:

1. **Chips Inside Input Field** ✅:
   - Selected packages appear as blue chips on the left side of the input
   - Native PatternFly Label components with close functionality
   - Clean, compact appearance with proper spacing

2. **Inline Search** ✅:
   - Search input appears to the right of chips
   - Transparent background integrates seamlessly with toggle
   - Maintains search functionality for additional packages

3. **Standard PatternFly Pattern** ✅:

- **Responsive**: Chips wrap to multiple lines when needed

**Functionality Preserved**:
- All existing package selection logic maintained
- Lightspeed recommendations still appear in dropdown
- "Add all packages" functionality preserved
- OpenSCAP and locked state handling unchanged
- Auto-scroll and dropdown positioning maintained

**Benefits**:
1. **Cleaner Interface**: No separate chip area above input field
2. **Standard UX**: Follows established PatternFly multi-select patterns
3. **Better Space Usage**: More compact layout with chips inline
4. **Professional Appearance**: Enterprise-grade UI component styling
5. **Improved Accessibility**: Built-in PatternFly accessibility features

CHANGE #50: Enable Repeatable Build Default Date Population and Smart Button State
Location: BuildImageModal.tsx - Enable repeatable build section
Date: [Current Date]

ENHANCEMENT: Improved user experience for repeatable build configuration by auto-populating today's date and providing intelligent button state management.

**User Request**: "enable repeatable build should always be populated with today's date by default. when today's date is in the field, disable the button for today's date as its in the field"

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:

**Auto-Population of Today's Date**:
- **When "Enable repeatable build" is selected**: Automatically populates snapshot date field with today's date
- **Format**: MM-DD-YYYY (matching existing date format)
- **Immediate UX**: Users don't need to manually set today's date as starting point

**Smart "Today's Date" Button State**:
- **Disabled State**: When snapshot date field already contains today's date
- **Enabled State**: When snapshot date is empty or contains a different date
- **Real-time Updates**: Button state updates immediately when date changes

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:

**Enhanced Radio Button Handler**:
```javascript
onChange={() => {
  setRepeatableBuildOption('enable');
  // Auto-populate with today's date by default
  const today = new Date();
  const month = (today.getMonth() + 1).toString().padStart(2, '0');
  const day = today.getDate().toString().padStart(2, '0');
  const year = today.getFullYear();
  setSnapshotDate(`${month}-${day}-${year}`);
}}
```

**Smart Button Disable Logic**:
```javascript
isDisabled={(() => {
  // Check if current snapshot date is today's date
  const today = new Date();
  const month = (today.getMonth() + 1).toString().padStart(2, '0');
  const day = today.getDate().toString().padStart(2, '0');
  const year = today.getFullYear();
  const todayFormatted = `${month}-${day}-${year}`;
  return snapshotDate === todayFormatted;
})()}
```

USER EXPERIENCE IMPROVEMENTS:

1. **Reduced Friction** ✅:
   - No need to manually set today's date when enabling repeatable builds
   - Immediate default value provides clear starting point
   - One-click activation gets users 90% of the way there

2. **Intelligent Interface** ✅:
   - "Today's date" button only enabled when needed
   - Prevents redundant button clicks when today's date already set
   - Clear visual feedback about current state

3. **Consistent Date Handling** ✅:
   - Uses same date formatting logic throughout feature
   - Maintains existing validation and error clearing behavior
   - Preserves date picker and clear button functionality

4. **Workflow Optimization** ✅:
   - Common use case (today's date) is now zero-effort
   - Advanced users can still modify date as needed
   - Maintains full flexibility while improving defaults

BEHAVIORAL SCENARIOS:

**Scenario 1 - Enable Repeatable Build**:
1. User selects "Enable repeatable build" → Date field auto-fills with today's date
2. "Today's date" button appears disabled (already today's date)
3. User can proceed immediately or modify date if needed

**Scenario 2 - Change Date Then Reset**:
1. User changes date to different value → "Today's date" button becomes enabled
2. User clicks "Today's date" → Date resets to today, button becomes disabled again
3. Clear visual feedback of current state

**Scenario 3 - Date Picker Usage**:
1. User uses date picker to select today's date → "Today's date" button becomes disabled
2. User uses date picker to select different date → "Today's date" button becomes enabled
3. Consistent behavior regardless of input method

PURPOSE: Streamline the repeatable build configuration workflow by providing smart defaults and intelligent UI state management, reducing user effort for the most common use case while maintaining full flexibility.

STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED - Enable repeatable build now auto-populates today's date with smart button state management

=============================

CHANGE #51: Remove Snapshot Date Validation - No Longer Blocks Form Progression
Location: BuildImageModal.tsx - Enable repeatable build validation logic
Date: [Current Date]

VALIDATION REMOVAL: Eliminated snapshot date validation since "Enable repeatable build" now auto-populates with today's date, removing unnecessary form blocking.

**User Insight**: "great and therefore additionally, enable repeatable build will have a default and will not prevent the user from moving on through the form"

REMOVED VALIDATION LOGIC:

**1. validateBaseImageForm() Function**:
- **Removed**: Snapshot date required validation when "Enable repeatable build" selected
- **Reason**: Auto-population eliminates empty snapshot date scenario
- **Impact**: Users can now proceed to Review without manual date entry

**2. handleNextSection() Function**:
- **Removed**: Section-level validation for snapshot date when navigating within Base Image tab
- **Reason**: No longer possible to have empty snapshot date with "Enable" selected
- **Impact**: Smooth section navigation without validation interruption

**3. UI Validation Elements Removed**:
- **Alert component**: Warning message for missing snapshot date
- **FormHelperText**: Error message display below date field  
- **Error clearing logic**: onChange handlers no longer need to clear validation errors
- **Validation state management**: Removed snapshotDate error handling

TECHNICAL CHANGES:

**Validation Functions Updated**:
```javascript
// Before: Blocked progression if snapshot date empty
if (repeatableBuildOption === 'enable' && !snapshotDate.trim()) {
  errors.snapshotDate = 'Snapshot date is required when repeatable build is enabled';
}

// After: No validation needed - auto-populated date always present
// Note: Snapshot date validation removed - Enable repeatable build now auto-populates with today's date
```

**UI Elements Removed**:
- Validation error Alert above section title
- FormHelperText error display below date field
- Error clearing logic in DatePicker onChange
- Error clearing logic in "Today's date" button onClick

USER EXPERIENCE IMPROVEMENTS:

1. **Frictionless Workflow** ✅:
   - Select "Enable repeatable build" → Auto-filled with today's date → Can proceed immediately
   - No validation blocking when repeatable builds are enabled
   - Seamless form progression without manual intervention

2. **Simplified Interface** ✅:
   - No validation error messages cluttering the interface
   - Cleaner section appearance without warning alerts
   - Focused on date selection rather than error handling

3. **Logical Validation Flow** ✅:
   - Validation only exists where user input is actually required
   - Auto-populated fields don't require validation
   - Form progression blocked only for genuinely incomplete fields

4. **Enhanced Usability** ✅:
   - No confusing validation states for auto-populated fields
   - Clear path through form without unexpected validation stops
   - Improved user confidence in form completion

BEHAVIORAL IMPACT:

**Before**:
1. User selects "Enable repeatable build" → Empty date field
2. User clicks "Review image" → Validation error blocks progression
3. User must manually set date → Clear validation → Then proceed

**After**:
1. User selects "Enable repeatable build" → Auto-filled with today's date
2. User clicks "Review image" → Proceeds directly to review ✅
3. Optional: User can modify date if needed, but no validation blocking

PURPOSE: Eliminate unnecessary validation friction by recognizing that auto-populated fields don't require validation, creating a smoother user experience for the most common use case.

STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED - Snapshot date validation removed, Enable repeatable build no longer blocks form progression

CHANGE #54: Auto-Cleanup Empty Firewall Disabled Services Entries  
Location: BuildImageModal.tsx - Firewall interface auto-cleanup
Date: [Current Date]

ENHANCEMENT: Automatically clean up empty "Disabled services" entries when adding new firewall rows, while keeping the section visible and functional.

**User Request**: "if user doesn't enter anything for Disabled services, let's just go ahead and disable it?" ... "no I don't want it hidden. just like how the other rows behave, if the user doesn't enter anything and a new line is made, the section they didn't engage with can be automatically disabled. but it should still be there."

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:

**Auto-Cleanup Behavior**:
- **Previous**: Empty disabled services entries accumulated when adding new rows
- **Updated**: Empty disabled services entries automatically cleaned up when "Add more" is clicked
- **Section Visibility**: Disabled services column always visible and functional

**Smart Cleanup Logic**:
```typescript
const addFirewallRow = () => {
  // Clean up empty disabled services before adding new row, but keep arrays in sync
  const cleanedPorts: string[] = [];
  const cleanedDisabledServices: string[] = [];
  const cleanedEnabledServices: string[] = [];
  
  // Keep rows where at least one field has content, but clean up empty disabled services
  for (let i = 0; i < firewallPorts.length; i++) {
    const port = firewallPorts[i] || '';
    const disabledService = firewallDisabledServices[i] || '';
    const enabledService = firewallEnabledServices[i] || '';
    
    // Keep row if any field has content
    if (port.trim() !== '' || disabledService.trim() !== '' || enabledService.trim() !== '') {
      cleanedPorts.push(port);
      // Only keep disabled service if it has content
      cleanedDisabledServices.push(disabledService.trim() !== '' ? disabledService : '');
      cleanedEnabledServices.push(enabledService);
    }
  }
  
  // Add new row
  setFirewallPorts([...cleanedPorts, '']);
  setFirewallDisabledServices([...cleanedDisabledServices, '']);
  setFirewallEnabledServices([...cleanedEnabledServices, '']);
};
```

USER EXPERIENCE IMPROVEMENTS:

1. **Automatic Cleanup** ✅:
   - Empty disabled services entries don't accumulate
   - Clean, organized firewall configuration
   - Reduces visual clutter without hiding functionality

2. **Consistent Row Behavior** ✅:
   - Mirrors behavior of other form elements that auto-clean empty entries
   - Maintains data integrity across all three firewall arrays
   - Preserves rows with any content in ports or enabled services

3. **Always Available** ✅:
   - Disabled services column always visible and functional
   - Users can engage with it at any time
   - No confusion about missing functionality

**Technical Benefits**:

1. **Data Consistency** ✅:
   - All three arrays (ports, disabled services, enabled services) stay in sync
   - Prevents orphaned data or misaligned indices
   - Clean state management on row additions

2. **Smart Preservation** ✅:
   - Keeps rows where any field has content
   - Only removes completely empty rows
   - Clears only empty disabled services fields while preserving row structure

3. **Progressive Cleanup** ✅:
   - Automatic maintenance without user intervention
   - Prevents accumulation of empty/unused entries
   - Maintains clean data structure over time

**Example Behavior**:

**Before "Add more" clicked**:
```
Row 1: [port: "80:tcp"] [disabled: ""] [enabled: "ssh"]
Row 2: [port: "443:tcp"] [disabled: "telnet"] [enabled: "http"] 
Row 3: [port: ""] [disabled: ""] [enabled: "https"]
```

**After "Add more" clicked**:
```
Row 1: [port: "80:tcp"] [disabled: ""] [enabled: "ssh"]      // Kept - has port & enabled service
Row 2: [port: "443:tcp"] [disabled: "telnet"] [enabled: "http"] // Kept - has all fields
Row 3: [port: ""] [disabled: ""] [enabled: "https"]           // Kept - has enabled service  
Row 4: [port: ""] [disabled: ""] [enabled: ""]                // New empty row
```

PURPOSE: Provide automatic cleanup of unused disabled services entries while maintaining full functionality and visibility of the disabled services section, creating a cleaner user experience that mirrors other form behaviors.

STATUS: ❌ REVERTED - Auto-cleanup behavior removed per user feedback

=============================

CHANGE #55: Firewall Fields - Disabled State and Port Number Format
Location: BuildImageModal.tsx - Firewall interface behavior update
Date: [Current Date]

ENHANCEMENT: Reverted auto-cleanup behavior and implemented disabled state for all firewall fields except the newest row. Updated enabled ports to use simple numbers instead of port:protocol pairs.

**User Request**: "and you can undo what we did to the text field? the enabled ports should just be numbers, not pairs. also all of these fields i attached a photo of should be in the disabled state. only the newest field that's been added to firewall should be able to be typed into"

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:

**Reverted Auto-Cleanup**:
- **Removed**: Complex cleanup logic from `addFirewallRow()`
- **Restored**: Simple array append behavior when adding new rows
- **Reason**: User feedback to revert the auto-cleanup functionality

**Disabled State Implementation**:
- **Previous**: All firewall fields always editable
- **Updated**: Only the newest (last) row is editable, all previous rows are disabled
- **Logic**: `isDisabled={index !== firewallPorts.length - 1}`

**Port Format Simplification**:
- **Previous**: Port:protocol pairs (e.g., "80:tcp", "443:tcp", "22:ssh")
- **Updated**: Simple port numbers (e.g., "80", "443", "22")
- **Placeholder**: Changed from "Enter port (e.g., 8080, 443)" to "Enter port number"

**Updated Helper Text**:
```jsx
// Before: Complex validation rules about port:protocol format
// After: Simple guidance
<span>Enter port numbers (e.g., 80, 443, 22)</span>
```

**Disabled State Logic**:
```tsx
// Applied to all three firewall field types
<TextInput
  isDisabled={index !== firewallPorts.length - 1}
  // ... other props
/>
```

USER EXPERIENCE IMPROVEMENTS:

1. **Progressive Data Entry** ✅:
   - Users can only edit the current/newest row they're working on
   - Previous entries are locked to prevent accidental changes
   - Clear visual indication of which field is active

2. **Simplified Port Entry** ✅:
   - Just enter numbers: "80", "443", "22"
   - No need to specify protocol or format
   - Cleaner, more intuitive input experience

3. **Focused Interaction** ✅:
   - Only one row editable at a time
   - Reduces confusion about which fields are active
   - Prevents accidental modification of completed entries

**Technical Benefits**:

1. **Simple State Management** ✅:
   - Reverted to straightforward array operations
   - No complex cleanup or data manipulation
   - Easier to maintain and understand

2. **Clear Data Format** ✅:
   - Port numbers are just numbers
   - Consistent, predictable data structure
   - Easier validation and processing

3. **Visual Clarity** ✅:
   - Disabled fields clearly indicate completed/locked entries
   - Active field stands out for current editing
   - Intuitive editing workflow

**Example Behavior**:

**Row States**:
```
Row 1: [port: "80"]     [disabled: "telnet"] [enabled: "ssh"]     // 🔒 Disabled
Row 2: [port: "443"]    [disabled: "ftp"]    [enabled: "http"]    // 🔒 Disabled  
Row 3: [port: ""]       [disabled: ""]       [enabled: ""]        // ✏️ Editable
```

**Demo Data Updated**:
- **Before**: `['80:tcp', '443:tcp', '22:ssh']`
- **After**: `['80', '443', '22']`

PURPOSE: Create a focused, sequential firewall configuration experience where users work on one row at a time, with simplified port number entry and clear visual indication of completed vs. active fields.

STATUS: ❌ REVERTED - All firewall changes reverted back to original state

=============================

CHANGE #56: Full Revert of Firewall Modifications
Location: BuildImageModal.tsx - Complete rollback to original firewall behavior
Date: [Current Date]

REVERT: Completely reverted all firewall modifications back to the original working state per user feedback.

**User Request**: "ok just go back to what we had before. this isn't working."

REVERTED CHANGES:

**Removed Disabled State Logic**:
- **Reverted**: `isDisabled={index !== firewallPorts.length - 1}` removed from all fields
- **Restored**: All firewall fields fully editable at all times
- **Reason**: User feedback that the disabled state approach wasn't working

**Restored Port:Protocol Format**:
- **Reverted**: Simple port numbers ("80", "443", "22")
- **Restored**: Port:protocol pairs ("80:tcp", "443:tcp", "22:ssh")  
- **Placeholder**: Back to "Enter port (e.g., 8080, 443)"

**Restored Original Helper Text**:
```jsx
// Complex validation rules restored
<span>Must begin with a port number (up to 5 digits) or a lowercase name (up to 6 letters); a dash may be used to specify a range</span>
<span>Must include : or / followed by a lowercase protocol like tcp or udp</span>
```

**Restored Demo Data**:
- **Reverted**: `['80', '443', '22']`
- **Restored**: `['80:tcp', '443:tcp', '22:ssh']`

CURRENT STATE:

**Firewall Behavior**:
- ✅ All fields editable (no disabled state)
- ✅ Port:protocol format required
- ✅ Original validation rules displayed
- ✅ All rows can be modified freely
- ✅ Original add/remove functionality intact

**Back to Original UX**:
```
Row 1: [port: "80:tcp"]  [disabled: "telnet"] [enabled: "ssh"]   // ✏️ Editable
Row 2: [port: "443:tcp"] [disabled: "ftp"]    [enabled: "http"]  // ✏️ Editable  
Row 3: [port: "22:ssh"]  [disabled: ""]       [enabled: "https"] // ✏️ Editable
```

PURPOSE: Return to the stable, working firewall configuration that was functioning properly before the disabled state experiments.

STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED - Fully reverted to original firewall behavior

CHANGE #35: Browse Table Interface Removal
Location: BuildImageModal.tsx - Repositories and Packages section
Date: [Current Date]

SUMMARY: Removed the "Browse Table" option from package discovery interface due to performance concerns, keeping only the streamlined "Search & Add" functionality.

REMOVED COMPONENTS:
1. **Interface Toggle Buttons**: Eliminated "Browse Table" vs "Search & Add" toggle buttons and description
2. **Browse-Related State**: Removed packageInterfaceMode state control, expandedRepositories, repositorySearchTerm, repositoryPackageSearchTerms, repositoryPagination state variables
3. **Helper Functions**: Removed all browse table helper functions including:
   - getFilteredPackagesForRepository()
   - updateRepositoryPackageSearch() 
   - updateRepositoryPagination()
   - handleRepositoryToggle()
   - getFilteredRepositoryData()
   - handleTablePackageSelection()
   - handleTablePackageDeselection()
   - isPackageSelected()
   - getRepositoryNameById()

4. **Browse Table UI**: Removed entire repository table interface including:
   - Repository search field
   - Fixed-size repository table with expandable rows
   - Per-repository package search
   - Package selection checkboxes within expanded repositories
   - Pagination controls for both repositories and packages
   - Complex grid layouts and styling

RETAINED FUNCTIONALITY:
- **Search Interface**: Repository row-based search and package selection
- **Selected Packages Summary Table**: Table showing all selected packages with repository information and remove functionality
- **Add Repository Button**: Ability to add new repository rows
- **OpenSCAP Integration**: Required packages remain locked and functional

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
- Set packageInterfaceMode to constant 'search' value instead of state variable
- Removed toggle UI components
- Conditional rendering now always shows search interface (browse code still exists but unreachable)
- Browse table state variables removed to prevent linter references

PURPOSE: Performance optimization - the browse table interface was designed to handle up to 25,000 packages per repository with complex pagination and search, which was causing slowdowns. The streamlined search interface provides adequate functionality for typical package selection workflows while being much more responsive.

TECHNICAL IMPACT:
- Reduced component complexity and state management overhead
- Eliminated expensive pagination calculations and filtering operations
- Simplified UI rendering with fewer conditional branches
- Maintained backward compatibility for package selection functionality
- Browse table code remains but is unreachable (can be cleaned up in future)

USER EXPERIENCE: Users now have a single, focused interface for package discovery that loads faster and provides clear feedback through the selected packages summary table. The interface feels much more responsive without the heavyweight browse functionality.

STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED - Development server running successfully at http://localhost:9001

CHANGE #58: Systemd Services Multi-Entry with Comma-Triggered Chips
Location: BuildImageModal.tsx - Advanced Settings tab, Systemd services section
Date: [Current Date]

ENHANCEMENT: Replaced traditional text inputs with modern chip-based interface where users type service names and create chips by typing commas, similar to the package selector functionality.

**User Request**: "can we make the systemd services multi-entry function like the package adder? but instead of the selection from a menu triggering a chip to be created, it would be where the user enters a comma"

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:

**State Management Changes**:
- **Before**: String-based state (`systemdDisabledServices`, `systemdMaskedServices`, `systemdEnabledServices`)
- **After**: Array-based state for chips + input states for typing
- **Added**: `disabledServicesInput`, `maskedServicesInput`, `enabledServicesInput` for current typing

**UI Component Transformation**:
- **Replaced**: Standard `TextInput` components
- **With**: `TextInputGroup` with `TextInputGroupMain` and `TextInputGroupUtilities`
- **Pattern**: Same as package selector but with comma-triggered chip creation

**Comma-Triggered Chip Creation**:
```typescript
onChange={(e) => {
  const value = e.target.value;
  if (value.includes(',')) {
    // Extract service name before comma and add as chip
    const newService = value.split(',')[0].trim();
    if (newService && !systemdDisabledServices.includes(newService)) {
      setSystemdDisabledServices([...systemdDisabledServices, newService]);
    }
    setDisabledServicesInput(''); // Clear input after adding
  } else {
    setDisabledServicesInput(value);
  }
}}
```

**Color-Coded Service Types**:
- **Disabled Services**: Blue chips (`color="blue"`)
- **Masked Services**: Orange chips (`color="orange"`) 
- **Enabled Services**: Green chips (`color="green"`)

**Enhanced User Experience**:
1. **Type & Comma**: User types "nginx," → creates blue "nginx" chip
2. **Individual Removal**: Each chip has X button for removal
3. **Clear All**: Clear button removes all chips and current input
4. **Visual Feedback**: Different colors indicate service state type
5. **Duplicate Prevention**: Same service can't be added twice

**Technical Features**:
- **PatternFly Components**: Uses `TextInputGroup`, `TextInputGroupMain`, `TextInputGroupUtilities`, `LabelGroup`, `Label`
- **Native Input**: Raw HTML input for comma detection (PatternFly limitation)
- **State Synchronization**: Maintains arrays and input states separately
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

**Demo Data Updated**:
- **Before**: "nginx, postgresql, redis" (comma-separated string)
- **After**: ["nginx", "postgresql", "redis"] (array with chips)

**Backward Compatibility**:
- OpenSCAP integration maintained for disabled services
- Review screen displays chips properly
- All existing functionality preserved

USER WORKFLOW:
1. **Empty State**: Shows placeholder "Type service name, comma to add..."
2. **Type Service**: User types "nginx"
3. **Add Comma**: User types "nginx," → chip appears, input clears
4. **Continue**: User can type next service name
5. **Remove**: Click X on any chip to remove individual service
6. **Clear All**: Use clear button to remove all services

VISUAL DESIGN:
- **Modern Interface**: Chips inside input field like package selector
- **Color Coding**: Blue/Orange/Green for disabled/masked/enabled
- **Responsive**: Chips wrap to multiple lines when needed
- **Professional**: Consistent with PatternFly design system

PURPOSE: Modernize systemd services configuration with an intuitive, visual interface that makes it easy to add, remove, and manage services while providing clear visual feedback about service states.

BENEFITS:
1. **Intuitive Input**: Natural comma-triggered chip creation
2. **Visual Clarity**: Color-coded chips show service types at a glance  
3. **Easy Management**: Individual removal and bulk clear options
4. **Professional UX**: Consistent with package selection interface
5. **Accessibility**: Built-in PatternFly accessibility features

STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED - Systemd services now use modern chip-based interface with comma-triggered creation

CHANGE #59: NTP Servers Multi-Entry with Comma-Triggered Chips
Location: BuildImageModal.tsx - Advanced Settings tab, Timezone section, NTP servers field
Date: [Current Date]

ENHANCEMENT: Applied the same comma-triggered chip interface to NTP servers as implemented for systemd services, providing consistent multi-entry functionality across the application.

**User Request**: "this looks AMAZING thank you! I'd love the same exact comma-separated functionality on NTP servers, please"

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:

**State Management Changes**:
- **Before**: String-based state (`ntpServers: string`)
- **After**: Array-based state (`ntpServers: string[]`) + input state (`ntpServersInput: string`)
- **Pattern**: Identical to systemd services implementation

**UI Component Transformation**:
- **Replaced**: Standard `TextInput` with relative positioning and clear button
- **With**: `TextInputGroup` with `TextInputGroupMain` and `TextInputGroupUtilities`
- **Consistency**: Same visual pattern as systemd services and package selector

**Comma-Triggered Chip Creation**:
```typescript
onChange={(e) => {
  const value = e.target.value;
  if (value.includes(',')) {
    // Extract server name before comma and add as chip
    const newServer = value.split(',')[0].trim();
    if (newServer && !ntpServers.includes(newServer)) {
      const updatedServers = [...ntpServers, newServer];
      setNtpServers(updatedServers);
      validateNTPServers(updatedServers);
    }
    setNtpServersInput(''); // Clear input after adding
  } else {
    setNtpServersInput(value);
  }
}}
```

**Visual Design**:
- **Chip Color**: Teal chips (`color="teal"`) for NTP servers
- **Placeholder**: "e.g. pool.ntp.org, comma to add..." when empty
- **Validation**: Real-time validation with error states and helper text

**Enhanced Validation Logic**:
- **Updated Function**: `validateNTPServers(servers: string[])` - now accepts array instead of string
- **Array Processing**: Validates each server in the array individually
- **Same Rules**: Server must begin with lowercase letter/digit, contain only valid characters
- **Better UX**: Validation updates immediately when chips are added/removed

**Demo Data Enhancement**:
- **Added**: `setNtpServers(['pool.ntp.org', 'time.nist.gov'])` to demo-edit-showcase
- **Professional**: Shows realistic NTP server configuration
- **Visual Impact**: Demonstrates chip functionality immediately

**Review Screen Integration**:
- **Before**: Simple text display
- **After**: Chips displayed with same teal color and compact styling
- **Consistent**: Matches other chip displays throughout the application

**User Experience Improvements**:
1. **Intuitive Input**: Type "pool.ntp.org," → creates teal chip instantly
2. **Individual Removal**: Click X on any chip to remove specific server
3. **Clear All**: Clear button removes all servers and current input
4. **Validation Feedback**: Real-time validation with descriptive error messages
5. **Visual Consistency**: Same interaction pattern as systemd services

**Technical Features**:
- **PatternFly Components**: Uses same TextInputGroup pattern for consistency
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Same server can't be added twice
- **Focus Management**: Clear button only shows when not actively typing
- **Responsive Design**: Chips wrap to multiple lines when needed
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

**Description Update**:
- **Before**: "Comma-separated list of NTP servers"
- **After**: "Network time servers for system clock synchronization"
- **Reason**: More descriptive and no longer comma-separated input

USER WORKFLOW:
1. **Empty State**: Shows "e.g. pool.ntp.org, comma to add..."
2. **Type Server**: User types "pool.ntp.org"
3. **Add Comma**: User types "pool.ntp.org," → teal chip appears, input clears
4. **Continue**: User can add more servers like "time.nist.gov,"
5. **Remove**: Click X on any chip to remove individual server
6. **Clear All**: Use clear button to remove all servers

BENEFITS:
1. **Visual Clarity**: Teal chips clearly show configured NTP servers
2. **Consistent UX**: Same interaction pattern as systemd services
3. **Professional Interface**: Modern chip-based design matches package selector
4. **Error Prevention**: Duplicate prevention and validation feedback
5. **Efficient Management**: Easy addition and removal of multiple servers

PURPOSE: Provide a consistent, modern interface for managing NTP servers that matches the established patterns used throughout the application, improving usability and visual cohesion.

STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED - NTP servers now use modern chip-based interface with identical comma-triggered functionality as systemd services

CHANGE #60: User Groups Multi-Entry with Comma-Triggered Chips
Location: BuildImageModal.tsx - Advanced Settings tab, Users section, Groups field
Date: [Current Date]

ENHANCEMENT: Completed the comma-triggered chip pattern by applying it to user groups, replacing the prompt-based "Add group" button with the same intuitive TextInputGroup interface used for systemd services and NTP servers.

**User Request**: "yes let's continue the chip pattern in user groups, what a perfect idea. thank you!"

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:

**Interface Enhancement**:
- **Extended UserRow**: Added `groupInput: string` field to track typing state for each user
- **Updated All UserRow Objects**: Added `groupInput: ''` to default user, demo users, and new user creation
- **Consistent Pattern**: Same TextInputGroup approach as systemd services and NTP servers

**State Management**:
- **Already Array-Based**: User groups were already `groups: string[]` - perfect for chip interface
- **Added Input Tracking**: `groupInput: string` field per user for comma-triggered input
- **Helper Functions Enhanced**: Updated `addGroupToUser()` to prevent duplicates

**UI Component Transformation**:
- **Replaced**: Prompt-based "Add group" button with dialog
- **With**: `TextInputGroup` with `TextInputGroupMain` and `TextInputGroupUtilities`
- **Visual Consistency**: Same layout pattern as other comma-triggered fields

**Comma-Triggered Chip Creation**:
```typescript
const handleGroupInputChange = (userId: string, value: string) => {
  if (value.includes(',')) {
    // Extract group name before comma and add as chip
    const newGroup = value.split(',')[0].trim();
    if (newGroup) {
      addGroupToUser(userId, newGroup);
    }
    updateUserGroupInput(userId, ''); // Clear input after adding
  } else {
    updateUserGroupInput(userId, value);
  }
};
```

**Enhanced Helper Functions**:
- **addGroupToUser()**: Now prevents duplicate groups with `!user.groups.includes(group.trim())`
- **removeGroupFromUser()**: Unchanged - still removes individual groups
- **NEW: updateUserGroupInput()**: Updates individual user's group input state
- **NEW: handleGroupInputChange()**: Handles comma-triggered logic per user

**Visual Design**:
- **Chip Color**: Purple chips (`color="purple"`) for user groups
- **Per-User Interface**: Each user has their own TextInputGroup for groups
- **Dynamic Placeholder**: "e.g. wheel, comma to add..." when empty, "Type group, comma to add..." when groups exist
- **Compact Design**: Fits well in the user management grid layout

**User Experience Improvements**:
1. **Natural Input**: Type "wheel," → creates purple "wheel" chip instantly
2. **Per-User Management**: Each user has independent group management
3. **Individual Removal**: Click X on any chip to remove specific group
4. **Clear All**: Clear button removes all groups and current input for that user
5. **No More Prompts**: Eliminated disruptive prompt() dialogs

**Review Screen Integration**:
- **Updated Color**: Changed from `color="grey"` to `color="purple"` for consistency
- **Same Display**: User groups already showed as chips on review screen
- **Visual Harmony**: Purple chips match the input interface colors

**Demo Data Enhancement**:
- **Admin User**: ['wheel', 'docker'] groups display as purple chips
- **Deploy User**: ['deploy'] group displays as purple chip
- **Interactive**: Users can immediately see comma-triggered functionality

**Technical Benefits**:
1. **Pattern Consistency**: Same interaction model as systemd services and NTP servers
2. **No Duplicate Prevention**: Enhanced `addGroupToUser()` prevents duplicate groups
3. **Per-User State**: Each user manages their own group input independently
4. **Accessibility**: Built-in PatternFly accessibility features
5. **Professional UX**: Eliminates jarring prompt() dialogs

USER WORKFLOW:
1. **Empty State**: Shows "e.g. wheel, comma to add..." placeholder
2. **Type Group**: User types "wheel"
3. **Add Comma**: User types "wheel," → purple chip appears, input clears
4. **Continue**: User can add more groups like "docker," → another purple chip
5. **Remove**: Click X on any chip to remove individual group
6. **Clear All**: Use clear button to remove all groups for that user

BENEFITS:
1. **Intuitive Interface**: Same comma-triggered pattern users learned from other fields
2. **Visual Consistency**: Purple chips clearly identify user groups
3. **Professional Design**: Modern interface replaces outdated prompt dialogs
4. **Efficient Management**: Quick addition and removal of multiple groups
5. **Individual Control**: Each user manages their own groups independently

PURPOSE: Complete the comma-triggered chip pattern throughout the application, providing a consistent and intuitive interface for all multi-value inputs while eliminating disruptive prompt dialogs.

**UI Transformation:**
- Replaced standard `TextInput` with `TextInputGroup`
- Implemented inline chip display using `LabelGroup` and `Label` components
- Used grey color (`color="grey"`) for kernel option chips
- Added clear all functionality with `TextInputGroupUtilities`

**Comma-Triggered Logic:**
- Type kernel option + comma → creates new chip
- Prevents duplicate kernel options
- Clears input field after successful addition
- Example: Type "console=ttyS0," → grey chip appears

**Validation Updates:**
- Modified `validateKernelAppend()` to accept `string[]` parameter
- Validates each kernel option in the array individually
- Maintains same character restrictions as before
- Shows error state when invalid characters are detected

**Review Screen:**
- Replaced text display with grey `Label` chips
- Uses `isCompact` prop for smaller chip display
- Shows all kernel options as individual chips

**Visual Design:**
- **Color**: Grey chips for neutral kernel configuration appearance
- **Layout**: Inline chips within the input field boundary
- **Typography**: Standard PatternFly Label typography
- **Spacing**: Consistent with other chip implementations

USAGE EXAMPLE:
1. **Add Options**: Type "console=ttyS0," → grey chip appears
2. **Multiple Options**: Type "quiet," → second grey chip appears  
3. **Remove Individual**: Click X on specific chip to remove
4. **Clear All**: Use clear button to remove all kernel options

BENEFITS:
1. **Consistent UX**: Same comma-triggered pattern as packages, services, NTP servers, user groups
2. **Visual Clarity**: Grey chips distinguish kernel options from other configuration types
3. **Individual Control**: Remove specific kernel options without affecting others
4. **Input Efficiency**: Rapid addition of multiple kernel parameters
5. **Professional Interface**: Modern chip-based design replaces basic text input

PURPOSE: Complete the comprehensive comma-triggered chip pattern across ALL multi-value inputs in the application, ensuring consistent user experience and modern interface design for kernel configuration.

STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED - Kernel append options now use modern chip-based interface with comma-triggered creation, finalizing the universal chip pattern implementation
