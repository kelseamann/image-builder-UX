Location: BuildImageModal.tsx - All dropdown/select components throughout the modal
Date: [Current Date]

Original Content: 
- Dropdown selections were permanent once made
- No visual indication of selected state within dropdown menus
- No way to deselect an option without changing to a different option

Current Content:
- All dropdowns now support toggle behavior: clicking the same option deselects it
- Blue checkmarks (CheckIcon) appear next to selected options in dropdown menus
- Toggle-off behavior returns dropdowns to appropriate default states:
  * Compliance dropdowns: clear selection and reset compliance type to empty
  * Integration dropdowns: clear selection and reset related fields

Suggested Content: [TO BE FILLED BY CONTENT WRITERS]
Notes: Removed the specific build time estimate ("Estimated build time: 5-15 minutes") as it isn't relevant for this implementation. The general guidance about the build process taking "several minutes" is retained to set user expectations without providing specific time estimates that may not be accurate.

PURPOSE: Simplify messaging and remove potentially inaccurate time estimates while maintaining user awareness that builds take time.

=============================

CHANGE #16: Advanced Capabilities Checkboxes for Automatic Registration

- Enabled services: "Enter services to enable" → "Comma-separated list of services to enable"

HELPER TEXT CHANGES:
- Disabled services: "Comma-separated list of services to disable" → "These services are installed but will not start automatically at boot."
- Masked services: "Comma-separated list of services to disable" → "These services are completely blocked from being started manually or automatically."
- Enabled services: "Comma-separated list of services to disable" → "These services are currently active and set to start automatically at boot."

CONTEXT: Updated all three systemd service fields to move format information to placeholder text and provide specific functional descriptions in helper text.

PURPOSE: Improve user understanding of different systemd service states and provide clearer input guidance by showing format requirements directly in the input fields.

IMPLEMENTATION: Updated TextInput placeholder attributes and helper text div content for all three service types (disabled, masked, enabled).

CHANGE #31: RHEL Version Support Lifecycle Details in Dropdown Menus
Location: BuildImageModal.tsx (Base Image tab), Dashboard.tsx (Migration overlay), ImageMigrationModal.tsx
Date: [Current Date]

ENHANCEMENT: Added detailed support lifecycle information to all RHEL version dropdown menus

CONTENT DETAILS:
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10: "Full support ends: May 2030 | Maintenance support ends: May 2035"
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9: "Full support ends: May 2027 | Maintenance support ends: May 2032"
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8: "Full support ends: May 2024 | Maintenance support ends: May 2029"

LOCATIONS UPDATED:
1. BuildImageModal.tsx - Base Image Release dropdown
2. Dashboard.tsx - Migration overlay "To" release dropdown
3. ImageMigrationModal.tsx - Migration target release dropdown

CONTEXT: Enhanced all RHEL version selection dropdowns to display support lifecycle information, matching the design shown in user mockups and providing critical support expiration dates.

PURPOSE: Help users make informed decisions about RHEL version selection by showing full support and maintenance support end dates directly in the dropdown options.

IMPLEMENTATION: Structured SelectOption content with main release name (fontWeight: 500) and support detail information below in smaller, lighter text (fontSize: '0.875rem', color: '#666').

VISUAL IMPACT: Each dropdown option now displays both the RHEL version name and its support lifecycle dates in a clear two-line format, improving user awareness of support timelines.

CHANGE #32: User Validation - Duplicate Username Prevention
Location: BuildImageModal.tsx - Advanced Settings tab, Users section
Date: [Current Date]

VALIDATION ENHANCEMENT: Implemented username duplicate validation with real-time feedback

VALIDATION RULES:
- Only requirement: Duplicate usernames are not allowed
- Real-time validation as users type
- Error clearing when duplicates are resolved

HELPER TEXT UPDATE:
- Original: "Create user accounts for systems that will use this image."
- Updated: "Create user accounts for systems that will use this image. Duplicate usernames are not allowed."

UI IMPLEMENTATION:
- Added `checkDuplicateUsername()` function to detect duplicate usernames across all users
- Added `usernameErrors` state to track validation errors per user
- Enhanced username TextInput with:
  - Real-time duplicate checking on onChange
  - Visual error state (`validated="error"`)
  - Error message display below input field
  - Smart error clearing when duplicates are resolved
- Added cleanup of username validation errors when users are removed

CONTEXT: Simplified user validation to focus solely on preventing duplicate usernames, removing any other validation complexity while providing immediate feedback to users.

PURPOSE: Ensure unique usernames across all user accounts while maintaining a streamlined user experience with clear validation feedback.

ERROR HANDLING: 
- Real-time validation prevents submission with duplicates
- Error messages appear immediately when duplicates are detected
- Errors automatically clear when duplicates are resolved
- Validation state cleanup when users are removed

[Future changes will be added below this line]

CHANGE #33: Validation Error Navigation Enhancement
Location: BuildImageModal.tsx - "Review image" button validation behavior
Date: [Current Date]

UX Enhancement: Smart Error Navigation with Automatic Scrolling
Current Behavior: When validation fails on "Review image", shows error message and scrolls to top of modal
New Behavior: When validation fails, automatically scrolls to the first error field location

Implementation Details:
- Enhanced validateBaseImageForm() function to return first error field reference
- Added imageDetailsRef for Image Details section navigation
- Updated "Review image" button onClick handler to scroll to specific error locations
- Uses smooth scrolling animation to guide user attention

Error Navigation Priority:
1. Image name errors → scrolls to Image Details section
2. Snapshot date errors → scrolls to Enable Repeatable Build section  
3. Cloud provider login errors → scrolls to Image Output section

Benefits:
- Eliminates user frustration from hunting for validation errors
- Provides immediate visual feedback on what needs to be completed
- Improves form completion workflow efficiency
- Maintains consistent validation message display

Technical Implementation:
- Uses React refs for precise section targeting
- Calculates scroll position relative to modal container
- Preserves existing validation error display logic
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing behavior

CONTEXT: Addresses user request to automatically navigate to the first validation error field instead of requiring manual searching through the wizard steps.

PURPOSE: Improve form validation UX by providing immediate, targeted navigation to incomplete or invalid fields.

ERROR HANDLING: 
- Smooth scroll animation guides user attention to problem areas
- Fallback behavior if refs are not available
- Maintains existing validation message display
- Works consistently across all validation error types

**CHANGE #34: Repository and Package Table Browser Interface**

**Location**: `BuildImageModal.tsx` - Base Image tab, Repositories and Packages section

**Summary**: Comprehensive package discovery interface with hierarchical repository browsing, per-repository search, pagination, and selected packages summary table for large datasets.

**Implementation Details**:
- **Interface Toggle**: "Search & Add" vs "Browse Table" modes
- **Repository Search**: Global search to filter repositories by name and description
- **Per-Repository Package Search**: Individual search fields within each expanded repository
- **Pagination**: 50 packages per page with Previous/Next controls
- **Selected Packages Summary Table**: Displays all selected packages with repository information
- **Performance Optimization**: Designed to handle up to 25,000 packages per repository

**Technical Features**:
- **State Management**: 
  - `packageInterfaceMode`: Toggle between 'search' and 'browse' modes
  - `expandedRepositories`: Set of expanded repository IDs
  - `repositorySearchTerm`: Global repository filter
  - `repositoryPackageSearchTerms`: Object mapping repository IDs to search terms
  - `repositoryPagination`: Object mapping repository IDs to current page numbers

- **Helper Functions**:
  - `getFilteredPackagesForRepository()`: Returns `{packages, totalCount, hasMore}` with pagination
  - `updateRepositoryPackageSearch()`: Updates search term and resets pagination
  - `updateRepositoryPagination()`: Updates page number for specific repository
  - `getRepositoryNameById()`: Retrieves repository name from ID for package summary table

**UX Enhancements**:
- **Repository Level**: Click to expand/collapse, shows package count
- **Package Level**: Search within expanded repositories, checkbox selection, detailed package info
- **Navigation**: Page indicators, Previous/Next buttons, result counts
- **Selected Packages Table**: Clear overview of all selected packages with repository source
- **Visual Design**: Hierarchical indentation, hover states, clear section separation

**Selected Packages Summary Table**:
- **Columns**: Package Name, Repository, Version, Support End, Remove Action
- **Features**: 
  - Shows package name with version
  - Repository source for each package
  - Support end date information
  - Individual remove buttons with MinusCircleIcon
  - Hover effects and professional table styling
  - Conditional display (only shows when packages are selected)
  - Package count in header
- **Functionality**:
  - Remove packages individually from summary table
  - Works across both search and browse interface modes
  - Real-time updates when packages are added/removed
  - Maintains package-to-repository mapping

**Data Structure**:
```typescript
repositoryData = [
  {
    id: 'repository-id',
    name: 'Repository Name', 
    description: 'Repository description',
    packageCount: 2847,
    packages: [
      {
        id: 'package-id',
        name: 'package-name',
        version: '1.0.0',
        description: 'Package description',
        applicationStream: 'RHEL 9',
        retirementDate: '2032-05-31'
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

**Search Functionality**:
- **Repository Search**: Filters repositories by name/description only
- **Package Search**: Per-repository search by package name/description
- **Pagination**: 50 packages per page with intelligent result management
- **Result Indicators**: Clear feedback on search results and pagination status

**Performance Considerations**:
- Search result limiting (50 packages default, 100 max search results previously)
- Per-repository pagination to handle large datasets
- Efficient state management with targeted updates
- Lazy loading approach with expandable repository structure

This interface provides a scalable solution for package discovery in enterprise environments with thousands of repositories and tens of thousands of packages, while maintaining clear visibility of selected packages and their sources.
